# School District Analysis
## Purpose
The purpose of the analysis was to see grade averages and % passing number of students per school, budget spent, and school size. The secondary part of the analysis was to complete the analysis without Thomas High School's ninth graders, as there was an assumption that their scores may have been tampered with
## Analysis
Below is a high-level summary of that analysis completed

  
  * After omitting Thomas High School's ninth graders from the analysis the math, reading and overall average grades dropped slightly. In addition in the comparison below I took out the ninth graders from the total student count as they weren't included in the secondary analysis

  * The math and readings scores for ninth graders showed up as NaN for Thomas High School in the school by grade analysis, the other grades were left unchanged.

  * The analysis and size had slight changes but the change was less than 1/10 a percent and therefore with the rounded averages the change was not seen

##
Summary
When the second analysis was completed the THS ninth graders values were changed to NaN, the reading math, overall grade averages, passing math percentage and passing reading percentage all slightly declined.
